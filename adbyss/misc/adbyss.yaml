# AdByss Configuration
#
# Adbyss is a DNS blocklist manager for x86-64 Linux machines.
# https://github.com/Blobfolio/adbyss
#
# Changes to this file affect the default program behaviors for all users.
##


##
# Hostfile
#
# The absolute path to the hostfile Adbyss should write block rules to. This is
# almost always "/etc/hosts", but if your system is weird, put in the correct
# value below.
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file) for general information.
##

hostfile: "/etc/hosts"


##
# Block Sources
#
# If for some reason you would like to exclude one of Adbyss' sources, set the
# value to false.
##

source_adaway: true
source_adbyss: true
source_stevenblack: true
source_yoyo: true


##
# Exclude Hosts
#
# Depending on your life, you may need to access a host Adbyss would normally
# block.
#
# Add any such hosts below to have them excluded from the blocklists, like:
#
# exclude:
#   - example1.com
#   - example2.com
##
exclude: []


##
# Exclude Hosts (Regex)
#
# For more complicated exclusion needs, you can provide any number of regular
# expression patterns.
#
# Add any such patterns below. Any host matching any pattern will be excluded
# from the blocklist.
#
# Note: hosts are automatically cast to lowercase; your patterns should only
# target [a-z] ranges.
#
# See https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.1/regex/index.html#syntax for regular
# expression syntax information.
#
# In practice this would look something like:
#
# regexclude:
#   - '(.+\.)*example.com$'
##

regexclude: []


##
# Custom Blocks
#
# If you have additional enemeies, add the host(s) below, like:
#
# include:
#   - example1.com
#   - example2.com
#
# You can also save any number of custom entries directly to your hostfile.
# Adbyss will preserve anything prior to the ADBYSS block when writing
# blocklist updates (unless the --no-preserve flag is set).
